# IaC Cloudflare
This project was created to learn how to configure Cloudflare DNS using Terraform.

To clone current Cloudflare state was used [cf-terraforming](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming) that consists in a CLI to clone current Cloudflare resources through account credentials.

To store the state I'm using Terraform Cloud Platform and official Terraform Github Action.
